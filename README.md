# deno_init

The initialization script to set up a deno project ðŸ¦•

To fetch and install the executable:
`deno_installer deno_init url/mod.ts --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write`

Note: this script requires network access to fetch a necessary dependency, and read/write access to set up the directory.

Once the executable is installed, run `deno_init <YOUR_DIRECTORY>` to set up your directory.
